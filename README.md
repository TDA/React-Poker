## README
This is a simple scrum poker game under development with React and Rails.

## Running locally
(Must have `rails` and `gem` already installed)
* Clone the repo
* Run rails db:migrate
* Run `gem install`
* Run `rails server`

Will update when I think of new stuff.

## Technologies used
1. Rails - Pretty much Vanilla
1. HTML - Sass
1. React
1. JSX

## Roadmap
Roadmap is essentially looking to get the MVP version out first.
The features for the MVP can be found as issues in the `Projects` tab on Github.
Long term vision is to have a fully working Scrum Poker app, that can support large, multiple teams.

## Feature requests
Feature requests can be created as new issues under the relevant projects.
Would love to add cool features that users think are valuable.

## Contributing
Would love to have contributors, the usual stuff applies:
* Fork the repo
* Make changes
* Create a PR
